 * This the basic of going htrough algorithms

 * (Euclidâ€™s algorithm). Given two positive integers m and n, find
 * their greatest common divisor, that is, the largest positive integer that evenly
 * divides both m and n.

 * The approach I am taking with this using Typescript with an interface to focus
 * on the shape of the types, this allows us to discribe what our function take
 *
 * We going to wrok out different solution which use different techniques
