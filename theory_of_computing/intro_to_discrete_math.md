## Notes on Discrete Mathematics
~~~
    I will be looking into:
    - Set theory.
    - relations and functions.
    - vectors and matrix manipulations.
    - mathematical proofs and,
    - propositional logic.
~~~
### I will be looking at declarative, causal, procedural and contextual on a high level.
