## Notes for Developer associate
- The terms of availability Zone, the customer Data is cashed before you access it.
- IAM basics
    - control of your AWS account.
    - shared access to your AWS account.
    - permissions.
    - Identity Federation.
    - IAM allows multi-factor Authentication and this allows - increase in access and resources.
    - IAM
        - Temporary Access.
        - password policies.
        - it integrated.
        - Compliance it supports PCI DSS.
    - Idenity Access Management
        - user
        - groups
        - roles
    - We also have to have to setup password policies in terms of requirements, we can also setup password expirations on the configure.
    - We have IAM roles which AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.
    - Testing IAM permisions
        - IAM Policy simulator
        - you can validate the policy if it works.
-  Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)
    - it running a virtual machines in the cloud.
    - EC2 you only pay for what you use.
    - The is no wasted capacity and you can grow and shrink when you need.
- Pricing models for EC2
    - On demand, you pay by the hour or seconds depending on the type of the instances.
    - Reserved instances capacity may be 1 or 3 years and you can get 72% discuont and this is reginal.
    - Spot is purchase unused capacity at a discount up to 90% and this prices fluctuate.
    - Dedicated is a physical EC2 server which is on prem.
        - On demand we lloking at:
            - Flexible workloads
            - Short-term Applications.
            - Testing the Application or the Cloud service.
        - Reserved Instances
            - Predictable usage, applications with steady state.
            - specific Capacity requirements applications that require reserved capacity.
            - Pay up-front this payment reduce thier total computing costs.
        - Types of reserved instances
            - standard is up to 72% off demand price.
            - covertable up to 54% on demand.
            - Scheduled.
        - Spot instances
            - flexible start and end.
            - low compute.
            - an urgent need for large compute.
- EC2 Instance Types
    - Hardware.
    - Capabilities different types of compute.
    - Application requirements 
    - more infor
        - General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads. 
        - Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors. 
        - Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.
        - Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.
        - Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.
        - The is a monitor for your Ec2 instance which is CloudWatch by default.
        - You can also add a bootstrap script in your Ec2 instance.
        - When you want to ssh into your instance you have to run ec2-user@(Ip address) -i and the key pair.
        - in this case we will have to start apache server by running systemctl starthttpd which will start the web server but allow auto on the server we will run systemctl enable httpd.
        - to check if everything is running, systemctl status httpd
    - EBS Volumes 
        - ebs is elastic block store, it is a storage you can attach to an EC2 instances.
        - you can used for run a database, run OS, store Data and install applications.
        - Mission critical
            - production workloads.
            - Highly available it replicates in a signle availability zone to protect against system failure.
            - Scable this mean it can is dynmically increase capacity and change the type volume.
        - EBS Volume types - Solid state disk(SSD)
            - General purpose SSD (gp2), we run 3 IOPS per GIB, up to maximum of 16 000 IOPS per volume, the gp2 volumes smaller than 1TB can burst up to 3 000 IOPS.
            - General purpose SSD (gp3), it is the latest generation the base line is 3 000 IOPS for any volume size (1GB - 16TB) they deliver up 16 000 IOPS and they 20% cheaper than gp2.
            - they both not latency sensitive.
        - Provisoned IOPS SSD(io1)
            - is the most expensive option on AWS.
            - you get 64 000 IOPS per volume 50 IOPS.
            - This is designed for I/O intensive applications, large databases and lantency-sensitive workloads.
        - Provisoned IOPS SSD(io2)
            - lasted generation.
            - Higher durability and more IOPS.
            - it is the same price as io1.
            - you get 500 IOPS per GIB and up to 64 000 IOPS
            - it is 99.9999% durable.
        - Provisoned IOPS SSD(io2 Block Express)
            - SAN(Storage Area Network) in the cloud, highest performance, sub-millisecond latency.
            - this uses EBS block express architecture.
            - 4x throughput, IOPS and capacity of regular io2 volumes
            - up to 64TB, 256,000 IOPS per volume and 99.999% durable.
            - This is for large, most critical high performance applications like SAP HANA, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2.
        - Throughput Optimized HHD(st1)
            - low-cost HHD volume.
            - baseline of 40MB/s per TB and the ability to burst up to 250 MB/s TB
            - maximum throughput of 500 mb/s per volume.
            - frequently-accessed throughput intensive workloads.
        - IOPS vs Throughput
            - IOPS
                - it measure the number of read and write operation per second.
                - important metric for quick transactions , low latency apps.
                - The ability to action read and write very quickly.
                - option to choose io1 or io2.
            - Throughput
                - it measure the number of bits read and write operation per second (MB/s).
                - important metric of large Datasets, complex queries
                - The ability to deal with large datasets.
        - setup an RDS volume on your EC2 instance
            - When creating a volume it needs to be in the same availability zone.
        - Elastic Load Balancer
            - A load balancer distributes network traffic across a group of serevers.
            - it allows us to increase traffic if the is alot of workload on the traffic.
            - Types of Elastic Load Balancer
                - Application load balancer, HTTP and HTTPS.
                - Network load balancer, TCP and high performance.
                - Classic load balancer http/https and tcp.(This is the legacy option)
            - Gateway Load Balancer
                - This allows you to load balanc workloads for third-party virtual applications running on AWS.
                - virtual application purchased using AWS market place.
                - virtual firewalls from companies such as Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco.
            - X-forwarded-for header
                - The X-Forwarded-For request header is automatically added and helps you identify the IP address of a client when you use an HTTP or HTTPS load balancer. Because load balancers intercept traffic between clients and servers, your server access logs contain only the IP address of the load balancer.
