## Notes for Developer associate
- The terms of availability Zone, the customer Data is cashed before you access it.
- IAM basics
    - control of your AWS account.
    - shared access to your AWS account.
    - permissions.
    - Identity Federation.
    - IAM allows multi-factor Authentication and this allows - increase in access and resources.
    - IAM
        - Temporary Access.
        - password policies.
        - it integrated.
        - Compliance it supports PCI DSS.
    - Idenity Access Management
        - user
        - groups
        - roles
    - We also have to have to setup password policies in terms of requirements, we can also setup password expirations on the configure.
    - We have IAM roles which AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.
    - Testing IAM permisions
        - IAM Policy simulator
        - you can validate the policy if it works.
-  Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)
    - it running a virtual machines in the cloud.
    - EC2 you only pay for what you use.
    - The is no wasted capacity and you can grow and shrink when you need.
- Pricing models for EC2
    - On demand, you pay by the hour or seconds depending on the type of the instances.
    - Reserved instances capacity may be 1 or 3 years and you can get 72% discuont and this is reginal.
    - Spot is purchase unused capacity at a discount up to 90% and this prices fluctuate.
    - Dedicated is a physical EC2 server which is on prem.
        - On demand we lloking at:
            - Flexible workloads
            - Short-term Applications.
            - Testing the Application or the Cloud service.
        - Reserved Instances
            - Predictable usage, applications with steady state.
            - specific Capacity requirements applications that require reserved capacity.
            - Pay up-front this payment reduce thier total computing costs.
        - Types of reserved instances
            - standard is up to 72% off demand price.
            - covertable up to 54% on demand.
            - Scheduled.
        - Spot instances
            - flexible start and end.
            - low compute.
            - an urgent need for large compute.
- EC2 Instance Types
    - Hardware.
    - Capabilities different types of compute.
    - Application requirements 
    - more infor
        - General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads. 
        - Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors. 
        - Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.
        - Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.
        - Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.
        - The is a monitor for your Ec2 instance which is CloudWatch by default.
        - You can also add a bootstrap script in your Ec2 instance.
        - When you want to ssh into your instance you have to run ec2-user@(Ip address) -i and the key pair.
