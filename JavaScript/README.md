## Going through JavaScript concepts

#### We will look at Primitive types
   * Numbers
   * Strings
   * Boolean
   * Null
   * Undefned
   * NAN is a numeric value that represent not a number.
   * Infinity 1/0 and a negative infinity.

#### Javascript can be run using node.js via the terminal or using your Dev tools.
   * we look at running node or node <file Name> in the terminal 
     ```
     <script src="file name"></script>
     when you want to use he HTML file with some javascript inside 
     ```
#### We look at operators in Javascript.
   * This are just the basic structures that allows us to use operators.
     ```
     points[1].x - points[2].y
     c++
     c--
     ++c
     --c
     c *=
     c /=
     this includes + and - as well
     we look at x === y -> equality
     x !== y -> inequality
     x < y -> less than
     () && () -> AND
     () || () -> OR
     !() -> NOT
     ```
#### A function is a named and parameterized block of JavaScript code that
#### you define once.
     ```
     function p(x) {
         return x * 2;
     }

     let z = 3;
     console.log(p(z));
     ```
