/*Statements are JavaScript sentences or commands
 */

/*Conditionals
 * They're like an if or switch statements the JS interpreter execute.
 * -> Loops 
 *  Statements such as a while and a for.
 *  -> Jumps
 *  Statements like break, return, and throw that cause the interpreter to 
 *  jump.
 */

/*The primtive statements withing the block end in semicolons, but the block it
 * self does not.
 * {
 *      console.log("cos = ", x);
 * }
 */
/*Looking at the realistic example for switch statement
 * 
 * function pass(x) {
    switch(typeof x) {
        case "number":
            return x.toString(10);
        case "string":
            return "''" + x + "''";
        default:
            return String(x);
        }
    }
    console.log(pass(5));
    *
    * for a switch statement to match a case it is safe to use === identity
    * operator to avoid any type conversion.
    */
/* A deep look into loops
 * JavaScript has 5 looping statements 
 * while, do/while, for, for/of(this for await concept) and for/in.
 * The common use of loops is to iterate over the elements of an Array.\
