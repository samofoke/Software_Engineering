// JavaScript does not treat every line break as a semicolon.

//BigInt is new feature in JavaScript 2020 it was added to allow the 
//presentation of 64-bit integers
//--> A string is an immutable ordered squence of 16-bit values.
//
//--> String are immutable, methods like replace(), toUpperCase() return
//new strings and they do not modify string which they are 
//invoked(call upon a function)
//
//-->Looking at Template Literals ${} this is a JavaScript expression
//
//-->Pattern Maching -this datatype is known as Regular Expresions
//This just as overview of Regular Expressions
//--/^HTML/ this matches the latters of html at the start of th string.
//--/[1-9][0-9]*/ it matches the nonzero digit, followed by any # of digits.
//--The pattern /\d+/g this matches all instances of one or more digits.
//text.slpit(/\D+/) this splits on nondigits
//

//Using the typeof operator on null return a string object as null can be 
//thought as an object which indicates no object.
//
//-->The Global Object
//It is a regular Javascript object that serves a very important purpose
//Primitives Values
//--Undefined, null, boleans, numbers and strings.
//Primitives are immutable
//Primitives are also compared by value: two values are the same only if
//they have the same value.
//
//Objects are different than primitives because they are mutable
//they values can change.
